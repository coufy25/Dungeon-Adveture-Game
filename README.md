Dungeon Adventure Game
Overview
This repository contains the source code for a text-based dungeon adventure game written in C#. The game allows players to create their characters, explore a dungeon filled with enemies and treasures, engage in battles, and level up their characters.

Game Mechanics
Character Creation: Players can create their characters by choosing a name, race, and profession. Races and professions have different attributes and abilities that affect gameplay.

Exploration: The dungeon is represented as a grid of rooms. Players can move their characters around the dungeon by entering commands such as "north", "south", "east", or "west". Each room may contain enemies to fight, treasures to collect, shops to visit, or empty rooms.

Combat: When encountering enemies, players can choose to engage in combat. Combat is turn-based, with players and enemies taking turns to attack each other. Players can use their character's abilities and items to defeat enemies.

Leveling Up: As players defeat enemies and collect experience points, their characters gain levels. Leveling up increases the character's attributes such as strength, health, and critical chance, making them stronger in battles.

Shops: Some rooms contain shops where players can purchase items such as weapons, armor, and potions using in-game currency earned by defeating enemies and collecting treasures.

How to Play
Setup: Compile and run the game using a C# compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.

Combat: When encountering enemies, choose whether to fight or flee. Use your character's abilities and items strategically to defeat enemies and progress further into the dungeon.
